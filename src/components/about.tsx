          Hi! I&apos;m a Full Stack Engineer with a strong focus on the{' '}
          <strong>MERN</strong> stack and <strong>Next.js</strong>. My journey
          in programming started in 2021, right after completing my intermediate
          studies. With a growing passion for technology, I pursued a ðŸŽ“{' '}
          <strong>Bachelor&apos;s</strong> degree in Computer Science to
          strengthen my foundation and enhance my skills. Currently, I&apos;m
          working at <strong>TechUp.Ai</strong>, where Iâ€™m building
          high-performance platforms using Next.js, TypeScript, and
          NestJS. I also gained valuable experience at{' '}
          <strong>Xenara AI</strong>, where I contributed to developing
          full-stack applications, optimizing performance, and implementing
          scalable solutions. I enjoy working across both front-end and
          back-end, turning ideas into functional, user-friendly products. My
          goal is to continue advancing in the field, with aspirations to become
          a Lead Software Engineer and eventually launch my own tech company.
          Iâ€™m always eager to collaborate and create impactful digital
          solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;m open to job opportunities where I can contribute, learn, and
          grow. If you have an opportunity that aligns with my skills and
          experience, don&apos;t hesitate to reach out.
